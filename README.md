Indian-Kids-Screen-Time-Analysis
📊 Analysis of Screen Time Habits among Indian Kids 📱 Insights into daily screen time, device usage, health impacts, and demographic trends based on a dataset of Indian children’s screen usage habits.

Short Description / Purpose
This project analyzes screen time patterns among Indian children to highlight the average daily usage, device preferences, and associated health impacts. It helps understand gender differences, rural vs urban trends, and the extent to which children exceed recommended screen time limits, with a focus on educational vs recreational usage.

📊 PivotTables & Charts – For summarizing trends and insights
🎛 Slicers & Filters – To enable interactive data exploration
📈 Charts (Bar, Line, Pie) – Visualization of age-wise, device-wise, and area-wise trends

Key Insights
📱 Smartphone is the most commonly used primary device
🌆 Urban kids tend to have higher average screen time compared to rural kids
👥 Males show higher screen time than females
⚠ A significant portion of kids exceed the recommended daily screen time limit
📚 Educational to Recreational usage ratio indicates more recreational use among kids

Data Source
